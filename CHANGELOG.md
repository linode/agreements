# Changelog
In addition to updates which reflect our implementation of innovative technologies and compliance with evolving regulations, Linode regularly utilizes community feedback for optimizing the legal, stylistic and organizational presentation of our legal agreements. Moving forward, Linode will also be utilizing changelogs to enhance transparency and to assist customer understanding of Linode’s commitment to privacy. We encourage all customers to review the entirety of Linode’s current legal agreements, as well as the below summaries highlighting key version-to-version changes. 


* **1.2.1** [15 October 2019]
	* **[Privacy Policy]** Update to General Terms and Privacy Shield Notice: the language defining "Linode" has been re-introduced and expanded to include "Linode International Services Company".

* **v1.2** [13 May 2019]
  * **[Privacy Policy]** Redundant Language Removal: The language in the introduction defining "Linode" has been removed because the term is already defined by the Customer Agreement.
  * **[Privacy Policy]** Redundant Language Removal: The language in the scope defining "you" and "your" has been removed because the terms are already defined by the Customer Agreement.
  * **[Privacy Policy]** Update Address for Notice: The address in Section 12 has been updated to reflect Linode's new headquarters.
  * **[Customer Agreement]** Subsidiary Clarification: The definition of "Linode" has been clarified for inclusion of Linode, LLC and Linode International Services Company to both the introductory paragraph and Section 15.15.

* **v1.1.1** [29 Oct 2018]
  * **[Privacy Policy]** Redundant Language Removal: The language starting at subsection (i) of section 5 and ending at subsection (iii) of section 5 is already discussed, in its entirety, in section 4. As such, we have removed the erroneous redundancy from section 5.
  * **[Privacy Policy]** Direct and Effective Access Clarification:  
      * The language "or your written consent" was inserted to the introductory paragraph of section 5 to confirm a Customer's ability to request for the disclosure of their Customer Data to third parties. Please note that Linode has always maintained that all Customer Data stored by a Customer on a Linode Resource belongs to that Customer. This means that each Customer has had, and will continue to have, (i) direct and effective access to their Customer Data and (ii) the right to enable access to their Customer Data to third parties at the Customer's discretion.  
      * The language "in the event of a Customer request for the disclosure of Customer Data, Customer will be responsible for the reasonable cost of disclosure efforts outside of Linode's normal course of business" was also added to section 5 to clarify that Linode will work with Customers on a case-by-case basis for determining the fees associated with Customer disclosure requests outside of Linode's normal course of business. Conversely, disclosure requests which Linode can accommodate in our normal course of business have been, and will continue to be, provided at no cost to Customer.

* **v1.1** [29 Aug 2018]  
  * **[Privacy Policy]** Privacy Shield Notice and Disclosures: To make it easier for you to find information about Linode’s participation in the U.S. Privacy Shield, we have incorporated a Privacy Shield notice at the beginning of our Privacy Policy. This section outlines Linode’s protection of your privacy during cross border transfers of data, how and why Linode shares your information with our subprocessors, and more clarity as to your dispute resolution options. 
  * **[Privacy Policy]** Legal Disclosure: The language “subject to service of lawful process” was inserted to Section 5 to make it abundantly clear that Linode only complies with legal disclosure demands when compelled by law. User privacy has been a part of Linode’s DNA since we first opened our doors, and we wanted to make sure our words were as unambiguous as our actions. 
  * **[Privacy Policy]** Payment Processor Updates: At the request of our payment processor, we globally changed references from Vantiv eCommerce, LLC to Worldpay, Inc. Nothing has substantively changed to the payment process for Linode goods and services. 
  * **[Privacy Policy]** Updated formatting and organization.

* **v1**  
  * Initial Commit
