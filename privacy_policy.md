Capitalized terms not expressly defined in this Privacy Policy shall have the meaning found in the Customer Agreement.

### Privacy Shield and Cross-Border Transfers of Personal Data
Linode is an international organization headquartered in the United States of America (the “US”). By utilizing a Linode Resource, you expressly consent to Linode’s access, maintenance, transmission and/or use of your Personal Data outside of your country of residence, regardless of location or jurisdiction.

This means that your use of a Linode Resource may result (i) in your Personal Data being stored and/or processed in any country that Linode, our affiliates or our subprocessors maintain facilities, and (ii) that while in such jurisdictions, your Personal Data may be subject to access pursuant to the laws of those jurisdictions (which may be more or less comprehensive as the laws of your country). To obtain a list of Linode’s affiliates and subprocessors, please email [support@linode.com](mailto:support@linode.com).

Linode participates and complies with the EU-US Privacy Shield and agrees that all cross-border transfers of Personal Data from/to the European Economic Area are subject to the EU-US Privacy Shield Principles. As a participant of the EU-US Privacy Shield, Linode is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the US Federal Trade Commission, and in some instances, may be required to disclose Personal Data to lawful requests by public authorities.	In the event of a conflict between the terms in this Privacy Policy and the EU-US Privacy Shield Principles, the EU-US Privacy Shield Principles shall govern.

### Third Party Transfers of Data
Linode may transfer Personal Data to third parties acting on our behalf when operationally necessary to provide the Services. If Linode has received your Personal Data in the US or the EU and subsequently transfers your Personal Data to a third party acting on our behalf, and such third-party agent processes your Personal Data in a manner that is inconsistent with the applicable Privacy Shield Principles, Linode will remain responsible and liable unless we can prove that Linode is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.

In the case of Customers, the Account Holder shall be responsible for (i) informing their End Users, if any, of the existence of this Privacy Policy, as well as any amendments, updates or modifications made to this Privacy Policy and (ii) agreeing to this Privacy Policy, as amended, updated or modified from time to time, on behalf of his, her or its End Users.
    
### 2.  What Personal Data is Collected by Linode?  
Linode considers any information that can be used to directly or indirectly identify you to be Personal Data, including without limitation, Personal Data that is accessed, collected, maintained, transmitted and/or used by Linode in the normal course of our business, and is subject to the provisions of this Privacy Policy and applicable law.
    
### 3.  How is Personal Data Collected by Linode?  
Linode collects and logs your IP address, the time and duration of your visit, the time and duration of the pages on Linode's website that you view (where applicable) and information about your computer system, such as your browser type and operating system, whenever a Linode Resource is accessed or used by you. In the case of Customers, we collect, maintain, transmit and/or use Personal Data provided by you in your Account, including without limitation, your full name, Linode identification number, billing data and contact information.  

Linode also collects anonymous usage information on Visitors to its website through use of [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com). Google Analytics may employ third party tracking cookies to gather anonymous browser, operating system, geographic, and website navigation information. Use of the Linode Manager interface requires the acceptance of cookies for login session management purposes.

Linode will likely place a cookie on your hard drive during the web visit. A cookie is a unique alphanumeric identifier that Linode uses to determine the number of unique Visitors that view its website, whether or not those Visitors are repeat Visitors, and the source of the visits. Cookies cannot be executed as code or used to deliver a virus. Other servers cannot read cookies and personal information cannot be gathered from cookies. Cookies are simply an identifier shared between you and Linode to allow Linode to improve the services Linode offers to you through its website. If you do not wish cookies to be placed on your computer, then they can be disabled in your web browser. The option to do so is normally found in your browser's "security settings" section. However, please note, permanently disabling cookies in your browser may hinder your use of Linode's website as well as other website and interactive services.   

A web beacon, also known as a web bug, is a small graphic (usually 1 pixel x 1 pixel), that is embedded in a web advertisement, email, or page on Linode's website, which is invisible to you. When you view a page on Linode's website, an e-mail or an advertisement, your web browser will request the web beacon from a web server, which in turn will set a cookie in your web browser containing a unique identifier. This unique identifier will be linked to log information that is used to track your usage of Linode's website in order to determine the effectiveness of content and advertising campaigns.

Linode does not collect personal information about you as part of a web visit, but web visit information may be tied to other information (including personal information) that Linode collects from you via chat, web forms, and the other means Linode describes in this Privacy Policy.
